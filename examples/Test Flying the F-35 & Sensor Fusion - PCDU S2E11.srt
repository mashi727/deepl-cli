1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
Coming up on Plane Crazy Down Under, we're joined by Lockheed Martin F-35 test pilot

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,040
Tony Brick-Wilson to discuss his flying career and find out a little about his amazing role.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,160
Every Australian aircraft that has come off of the line, either I or a member of my team

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
have flown it.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,480
And as this fifth generation jet continues to evolve, Director of F-35 International

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,600
Business Development Stephen Over talks about coming upgrades we can expect on RAAF models.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,000
This year we're breaking into production a new computing baseline that will update the

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,600
main mission computer on the aircraft, the computer that supports the cockpit displays

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,480
and the aircraft memory system.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,440
High flying, high tech, and one of the coolest jobs on earth.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,040
It's all ahead as we get Plane Crazy.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Well hi everyone.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Welcome back to the show.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
It's great to have you with us.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,240
This is of course the program where we like to take a look at Australia's aviation industry

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,680
and of course aviation all around this part of the world.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
I'm Steve Vischer.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,520
Joining me as always is my good friend Grant McGarren.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
How are you mate?

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
Hey, not too bad buddy.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
How are you doing?

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm doing very well and of course really looking forward to this episode.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm always doing well when we're about to talk about fast jets and we've got a really

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,000
good guest waiting for us who we'll introduce in just a few minutes.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,520
We're going to be covering the F-35 of course which is a maturing platform of course.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
We've covered this before.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,000
I remember back to episode 119 Grant when we first started really looking in depth at

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
the F-35.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,920
I think that was probably back in about 2014 or somewhere around there and it's certainly

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,040
become a mature platform these days and a lot has happened and a lot of development

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
has gone on.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,160
It certainly has mate and the big key phrase that we're hearing again and again is of course

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,280
sensor fusion and how the F-35 brings everything together so the pilot doesn't have to build

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,240
their situational awareness from multiple screens and inputs from all the different

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
sensors but the actual platform does it for them.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,360
And mate I think we should get straight on to it because we've got Tony Wilson, Chief

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,480
of Fighter Flight Operations at Lockheed Martin on standby.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,760
Should we get straight into it?

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Let's do it.

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Well g'day Tony.

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
How are you doing?

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Fantastic.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
I really appreciate you guys having me on.

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm really excited about this.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,000
Well Tony we'll kick off with the most important question of all and it's not going to be about

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,360
your call sign of brick which we'll also refer to you as but we'll come to that later.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
What got you into aviation?

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,960
You know I think the story of what got me into aviation is not really different than

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,120
any other aviation geek or nerd out there.

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,320
We all come from a place and we all have some sort of connection with it.

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,880
Mine came from my grandfather.

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,240
My grandfather had a love of aviation and from as long as I can remember he used to

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,200
take me to the airport and we would watch sit there and watch planes and we would bond

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,760
over it.

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,040
But I can tell you the moment that was solidified for me of when I would pursue this career

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,540
I grew up in South Florida in the early and mid 70s and we took a trip up to Kennedy Space

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:26,140
before the space shuttle had been flying but they had a life-size model of the shuttle

58
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,660
parked outside of the rocket assembly building and I can remember coming around the corner

59
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,380
and looking at this awesome machine and I turned to my teacher and I said hey how do

60
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,060
I get to fly that and she's like well Tony you have to be one of the best test pilots

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,540
in the world to get to do that and I was like ah I can do that now I'm not saying I'm the

62
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,580
best test pilot or even I'm a mediocre test pilot at best but that was what really propelled

63
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,020
me into this career.

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,580
Because Florida really has a really rich aviation scene there doesn't it I mean there's so much

65
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,460
going on in aviation there it's probably hard not to get hooked if you live there.

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Yeah absolutely you have Kennedy Space Center, multiple service bases you know McDill, Homestead,

67
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,540
Loredale International used to actually be a naval air station way back right and you

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,700
know pick almost any aerospace industry they've got some presence in Florida absolutely.

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,700
So living in Florida you got the bug can you step us through your career to date?

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Absolutely so I actually started off my career at the age of 19 I enlisted in the US Navy

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,140
and that was a result of me not being the best student coming through high school or

72
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:52,020
my first attempt at university and the Navy sent me to nuclear power school where I learned

73
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,380
to run nuclear reactors.

74
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,380
I did that for a couple years on a fast attack submarine where I was fortunate enough to

75
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,060
earn a slot in an officer program.

76
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,060
So I went off went back to university did much better this time earning a bachelor's

77
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,060
degree in mechanical engineering and then off to flight school in Pensacola Florida.

78
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,740
I took to fly in you know very naturally I did very well in flight school and earned

79
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:33,020
a jet slot I went on to jet training which I did in Meridian Mississippi.

80
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,020
Earned my wings of gold and went on to fly the F-18C so did that went through training

81
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,980
to what we call the replacement air group training squadron and then reported to VFA-87

82
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,940
for my first fleet squadron.

83
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,140
While I was with VFA-87 we deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I was flying off

84
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,020
the USS Roosevelt at the time.

85
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,860
At the completion of that tour again I was fortunate enough to be selected and earn a

86
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,860
slot for Navy test pilot school the Navy sent me off to earn my master's in aeronautical

87
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,900
engineering first and then off to test pilot school I did that for a year.

88
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,860
Upon completion and graduation of test pilot school my first assignment was to work the

89
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,900
F-35 program a very fortunate project coming out of test pilot school brand new test pilot.

90
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:44,900
I did that for about three years and then returned to the fleet flying F-18F super hornets

91
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,340
forward deployed in Japan off the George Washington.

92
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,540
We lived in Japan for two and a half years and returned back to the test community back

93
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,580
to the F-35 program where I was heavily involved in testing both the F-35B and the F-35C but

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,980
primarily the F-35C specifically preparing the aircraft to go to the aircraft carrier

95
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,220
which culminated in me getting to take the F-35C to the USS Nimitz in November of 2014.

96
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,220
I finished up my Navy career in 2016 and was fortunate enough to be hired on or I should

97
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:36,420
say joined Lockheed Martin as a test pilot and in 2018 I was selected to become the chief

98
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:45,020
of fighter flight ops still get to fly the F-35 but now I get to lead a fantastic team

99
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,020
of pilots all of the fighter pilots that are currently flying for Lockheed Martin so F-16

100
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:58,820
F-22 F-35 and whatever special projects that we have come up fantastic.

101
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,260
It's a tough life yeah they let me wear a flight suit to work and I still get to fly

102
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:11,260
high high performance machines so yeah best of all worlds exactly so a quick side question

103
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,540
then did you have much to do with Billy Flynn yes I know Billy very well.

104
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,660
So Billy and I overlapped at Pax River when I showed up during my second tour as an active

105
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,460
duty Navy pilot he was working for Lockheed at the time so that would have been 2013 we

106
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:43,260
worked closely together on the F-35 program then and then naturally when I joined Lockheed

107
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,580
Martin I continued to work with Billy until his retirement and I forget the exact date

108
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,140
you know 2018-2019 time frame cool yeah we've had him on the show before I ran into him

109
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,180
at Avalon so I'm hoping to okay we're going to see if we can get him back on he's quite

110
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,540
happy to chat with us again so we obviously didn't scare him off last time but so you've

111
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,580
mentioned that you were primarily on the 35 Bravo and Charlie when you were at the Navy

112
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,780
test pilot but I guess now you're flying all variants aren't you I fly all three variants

113
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,780
at Fort Worth our role here at Fort Worth is to take each and every aircraft as it rolls

114
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:29,780
off the factory floor and take it airborne for the first time so in this capacity you

115
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:37,540
know the A model and the C model the A model being the Air Force model conventional takeoff

116
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,820
and landing from runways and the C model the Navy version the CV variant we fly two flights

117
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:53,020
on each of those the B model the Stovall the hovering aircraft that gets a third flight

118
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,140
but on all three variants the first flight we are primarily checking out the vehicle

119
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,140
systems right is the aircraft built to the quality that we expect and demand from Lockheed

120
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,740
Martin to make sure that we're sending the best aircraft out to you know the war fighters

121
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,620
the men and women that are going to take this into harm's way the subsequent flights are

122
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,380
used to check out our mission systems which that's really where the magic of the F-35

123
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,380
resides in our mission systems and sensor fusion so we want to make sure that that's

124
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,220
all working properly and integrated per design and then like I said that B model gets a third

125
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,700
flight just to check out the Stovall systems. One of the selling points that people like

126
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,540
Billy Flynn have told us about in the past when we've interviewed him is the idea of

127
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,740
making transition into or even variations between the three different variants very

128
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,340
very similar making it easier for the pilot when you're the Stovall aspect of the B model

129
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,700
of course aside are they very different to fly between the three or are they when you

130
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,260
get in is it something that's actually really seamless for you to really adapt to? It's

131
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,820
seamless and I think that's one of the fantastic things that Lockheed Martin did with the F-35

132
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:14,180
whether I'm in an A a B or a C they all fly almost identical the mission systems are identical so

133
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,820
when I'm employing the aircraft you know I'm solving tactical challenges with it it's the

134
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,620
same right really the big difference is you know how they take off and land and how much

135
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,340
fuel they carry the the A model carries about 18,000 pounds the B model carries about 13,000

136
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,860
pounds you give up some fuel for the lift system and then the C model because of the the larger

137
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,420
wings you get a little extra fuel about 18,000 pounds 19,000 pounds and flying the B model I

138
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,340
mean is is that a heavier aircraft or is is one compensated from the other in terms of less fuel

139
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,420
versus the extra weight of the lift fan? So the the flight control system that our flight

140
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:03,180
control engineers put into this aircraft it's a really carefree handling so you really don't

141
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:12,140
notice any shift in CG or really the difference in weight they all fly almost identical you know

142
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,420
and that's that's really a strength because we're already seeing it on the US side with pilot

143
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,980
exchanges Air Force pilots going and flying different variants you know Navy and Marine

144
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:30,740
Corps pilots flying different variants and then even within you know our allies you know I think

145
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,820
it was just last year we had US Marine Corps B models flying with the Italians off of their

146
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,020
carrier right because it's the same aircraft. So I've been fortunate enough to get into the

147
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,740
cockpit demonstrator that was going around air shows and and you know demonstrations and things

148
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,500
like that and just flying it with that big screen of multi screens made up in front was pretty

149
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,180
amazing but I never got the chance to try an F-35 even a demo helmet to see what it was like from

150
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:09,300
the inside. How is that transition getting into the the helmet and transitioning into the F-35

151
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:16,020
what did that what was that like? So the biggest thing that pilots will first notice so I flew

152
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:23,540
the Gehmics 1 I have not had the opportunity to fly the Joint Helmet Mounted Queuing 2 but I also

153
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:33,020
believe that's a monocular so I went from a monocular system one projector to a binocular

154
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:40,700
system in the F-35 helmet so that took a I was surprised that took a little bit of getting used

155
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:49,260
to training your non-dominant eye to you know take in the symbology. With that being said it's still

156
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:57,240
a quick transition right so one of the things that pilots will first notice is the F-35 helmet

157
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,200
is probably the most comfortable helmet that a fighter pilot gets because one it's custom fit

158
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:10,160
to your your head when a pilot is selected to fly the F-35 one of the first things they do is we

159
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,880
send them to what's called the pilot fit facility where they put a latex cap over their over their

160
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,520
head and their head is scanned to map out all the ridges and divots and bumps and you know

161
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,160
irregularities that we all have on our skull fortunately they can't you know there's no

162
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,800
scanning of mental state because it probably would let me fly but but then that information

163
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,640
is sent off your your pads are custom cut they're sent back and then you come back the next day and

164
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,600
you put the helmet on they cut your visor so it's custom fit to you they make sure that there's no

165
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,720
hot spots or whatever you know so little tweaking of the the pads themselves so it's the best-fitting

166
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,520
helmet that I've ever worn you have active noise reduction in the ear cups and so that that's

167
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:17,120
fantastic you know it's like flying really reduces a lot of the noise but there is a there is a

168
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:28,040
transition the the pilot will spend the next couple of days tweaking the helmet and exactly

169
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,320
where the displays are to make sure that it is it's zeroed in right because if you compare it to

170
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:42,440
say you know the jahamics the field of view that is projected is much wider than the field of view

171
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,720
that is projected on an f-35 helmet if there you can see pictures out there where the display the

172
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,920
actual size of the display it's not much larger than the human pupil right and then and that's

173
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,320
by design and that's another reason why the helmet has to fit so good because you can't have this

174
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:07,440
thing jostling around on your head under G's or or whenever that that symbology has to be available

175
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:16,200
to you it at all times the symbology is focused for what we call infinity so it's just a seamless

176
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:23,040
transition as far as when you're flying the symbology overlying with the outside world again

177
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:31,000
it does take a little bit of getting used to when I first started flying I could actually feel the

178
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,880
muscles in my eyes change as the focal length varied but now you know I've been flying for a

179
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,000
number of years it's it's seamless I don't even notice it anymore okay because yeah you've got

180
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,360
that screen in front of you plus you've also got what's on your on your helmet how do the two

181
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,440
inter interrelate because if you if you look down to look at the screen is the outside view in front

182
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,120
of your pupils or is it only when you're looking up and out no it's it's still there but the the

183
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,760
helmet itself has three different tracking systems it has an inertial tracking system

184
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,960
and has a magnetic tracking system and then it has a visual tracking system with cameras inside

185
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:26,760
the cockpit so that the aircraft and the aircraft computers are aware of where that the pilots head

186
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,600
in orientation is all time so when I come in to look at the the glass we call it the glass

187
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,360
when come in to look at the glass the symbology is blanked right okay the only time that we won't

188
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:48,280
blank that symbology is we also have the capability to take the DAS system the six cameras around the

189
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:57,520
aircraft and project that imagery to the visor and that's really it's it's a useful system during

190
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,400
the day and we'll probably talk a little bit more about that later but as far as pilot visuals it's

191
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,240
used primarily at night this system really turns night into day for the pilot the other advantages

192
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,120
of the the f-35 helmet that you kind of need to get used to is it has your night vision camera

193
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:25,040
integrated into it so when I'm flying at night I can either turn all the visuals off all the

194
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,920
camera views I can have DAS I can have my night vision camera and I can do it all from the flick

195
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,160
of my thumb on the stick fantastic so that would really change the way you fight the aircraft in

196
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,240
many ways wouldn't it I mean it's all of a sudden it's taking a lot of things that perhaps you had

197
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,160
to give a lot of thought to in in older generation aircraft it seems to me now that you know again

198
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,000
it's it's designed to make things easier and I guess that that leads through to SA and and all

199
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,740
that sort of stuff yeah 100% you know the the helmet is just it's another tool that the pilot

200
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:07,720
has that helps him or her execute the mission and it's it's the seamless integration of all

201
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,000
the sensors through sensor fusion that's really that that generational leap right so when we talk

202
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,240
about the f-35 and we talk about it being a fifth gen fighter fifth generation fighter most people

203
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,320
automatically think about stealth and stealth is an definitely an important aspect of it you know

204
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,320
the stealth capability that the aircraft brings to the fight it's both an offensive and defensive

205
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,840
capability but really the other part of fifth gen is sensor fusion and what sensor fusion brings

206
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:53,600
to the pilot so for example when I was flying my fourth gen fighter over Iraq you know the f-18 very

207
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:04,280
easy aircraft to fly and that's by design but in my legacy f-18 I had to tell the radar where to

208
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:14,160
look what targets to prioritize I had to interpret what my RWR EW system was displaying to me I had

209
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:23,520
to prioritize you know what my targeting pod was looking at and more importantly is I had to listen

210
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,480
actively listen to a lot of information that was coming in over the radio to fill in the rest of

211
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,800
the information that was needed and I would build that tactical picture in my head so I was as much a

212
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:47,040
sensor manager as a tactician you know in my fourth gen aircraft what sensor fusion brings to

213
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:56,160
the pilot is it's the sensor manager okay it not only does it manage my sensors for me but it

214
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:04,320
optimizes them depending on what I do mission planning wise on the deck right so f-35 extremely

215
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,040
easy aircraft to fly and again that's by design because that builds in safety margins for the

216
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,520
pilot I'm not too worried about being a sensor manager because I have sensor fusion taking care

217
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,400
of that for me so really what that allows me to do is be that tactician right to quickly analyze

218
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:31,880
any tactical challenge that's presented to me and we do that via the glass and the PVI and how that

219
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,040
information is presented to the pilot and it allows the pilot to make those split-second tactical

220
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,000
decisions that need to be made to solve any tactical challenge that's out there I've heard

221
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,280
the reference to the f-35 being the quarterback of the mission being up in the air with all that

222
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,440
sensor fusion and calling the shots and giving people information and all that so I'm guessing

223
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,920
that keeps you pretty busy in the cockpit what's it like to be doing that quarterback role in

224
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,240
addition to flying and fighting the aircraft itself so every fighter pilot wants to be the

225
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,160
leader right that's that's just the nature right you know it's I'm the best pilot up here I want

226
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,680
to be in charge but what we're seeing is again if I compare it to you know my fourth gen experience

227
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:29,240
it would typically take a Navy pilot anywhere between 8 to 12 years of experience before they

228
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:38,280
got to the point where they could lead in the Navy what we would call you know an LFE or a large

229
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:46,140
force employment you know taking a large number of aircraft into a contested area and executing

230
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:54,720
some sort of strike because of sensor fusion and the pilots are achieving that level as early as

231
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,200
two to four years into their career right so I mean it's that's when we talk about generational

232
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,520
leaps you know that's one of the things the services you know training a pilot takes a lot

233
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,680
of resources you know it takes a lot of the country's resources to dedicate to each individual

234
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:19,000
pilot and they're getting a much better pilot much sooner because of the tools that take some

235
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,880
of the workload off the pilot and allow them to be you know the tactician that you want them to

236
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:32,040
be so when you talk about you know quarterback in the fight it's one it's it's fun it's exciting

237
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:39,400
it's a challenge to your professional skills but you know you get up there and the tools that the

238
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,760
aircraft provide you the advanced sensors the sensor fusion as well as the data links that you

239
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,800
know we haven't talked about you know all of this information comes in and is very succinctly displayed

240
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,080
to the pilot so that they're again able to make those quarterback calls and then you bring in you

241
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,000
know the added benefit of these advanced data links that we have link 16 and and metal and

242
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,640
the information that we're bringing in is also pushed out to everybody that we want to share it

243
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,040
with right so even you know the battlefield commanders that may be away from the forward

244
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:23,320
line where the action is happening they have the same amount of essay that the pilot in the cockpit

245
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,680
has because it's really it's really we hear a lot about this it's being a platform rather than

246
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,200
just an aircraft isn't it like you know this this is this is now changing the way I guess the

247
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,080
battle space is managed because it's it's an integral part of a system rather than just an

248
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,800
individual aircraft or a bunch of individual aircraft so at Lockheed Martin we're working

249
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:52,440
hard on what we call 21st century security right which is to to bring integrated capability to the

250
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:01,720
warfighter you know to be able to operate and exploit what we call jato or joint joint all

251
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,040
domain operation so when we talk about 21st century security and jato it's talking about

252
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:17,640
the integration of space assets air assets both land and sea assets as well as subsurface assets

253
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,200
and each of those entities being able to share information so that they can make the tactical

254
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:31,960
decision that they need so when we talk about the f-35 yeah it's the f-35 it's a very capable fighter

255
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:41,520
aircraft but it's also an ISR platform intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and when you talk

256
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:49,120
about it in a jato sense or 21st century security sense it's an airborne data node it's about you

257
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,640
know battle management or not battle management but information management because one of the

258
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,040
other aspects I failed to mention when I talked about the aspects of jato right and you know

259
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:07,880
space air surface subsurface but also cyber right and that's you know having an airborne data node

260
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:16,000
you know just adds to that capability and that's what the f-35 brings okay so I mean you're you're

261
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,760
sounding like a mini AWACS right there like a small e7 or e3 so how does the f-35 plug in with

262
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,960
those AWACS platforms like in the Navy sense you've got the e2 how does it supplement for the Air

263
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,160
Force talking to the e7 the wedge tail what's what's involved there you're not taking over but

264
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,920
are you able to give them more information than that otherwise have we are just because of the

265
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:53,840
sensors and the spectrum that our our sensors operate in and again it's because of link 16 and

266
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,920
being able to to pass that information so when you think about it you know if I have you know

267
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:08,840
a satellite with a certain capability in a certain part of the you know EM spectrum or

268
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:16,760
visual spectrum or whatever and the f-35 brings a different part of the spectrum you know to the

269
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,400
solution and maybe a ground-based radar you know and we're able to feed all of this information

270
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,000
in and you know it it's a force multiplier is what it is our special guest this week is Tony

271
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,080

284
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,520
Radio news you're listening to playing crazy down under the show where we talk aviation and our very

285
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,080
special guest this week is Tony Brick Wilson the chief of fighter flight operations at Lockheed

286
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,440
Martin the manufacturer of course of the f-35 Tony I have just one interesting side question there

287
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,680
because I should admit that one of my guilty pleasures is getting on YouTube and watching

288
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,960
cockpit video of carrier ops it just I could watch it all day long I notice when you're talking a lot

289
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,000
there about the ease of use and how much easier this aircraft is to fly I wonder if you could talk

290
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,680
about bringing it onto the boat bring it onto a carrier versus say bring an F you know bring an

291
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,960
F-18 onto the boat there seems to me to be so much going on in that cockpit so many micro

292
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,760
adjustments being made in the Hornet given that this aircraft is an easier aircraft to operate how

293
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,720
does that affect just coming onto the boat it's just a side question because these videos they

294
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:52,440
just fascinate me so what I can tell you is the f-35 builds huge safety margins into shipboard

295
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,800
operations there's a couple of things that we have going for us in the f-35 and to be fair it's not

296
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:07,240
just the f-35 the Navy has invested a lot of resources in bringing what the f-35 brings to

297
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,000
the pilot to the Hornet and they're also expanding it out to other aircraft in the fleet but the

298
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,920
f-35 we have what's called Delta flight path and and you're hundred percent right there's you know

299
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:30,720
multiple micro corrections and inputs while you're trying to land on the ship you know it's the the

300
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,320
task the basic task I can I can break it down into you know the naval aviation mantra is

301
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,720
meatball lineup angle of attack and what that means is you have the Fresno lens that has the

302
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,560
ball off to the left side and the pilots primary task is to keep it between the two green bars

303
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:59,120
what we call the datums the lineup is to make sure that you are on centerline because the landing

304
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,000
area on an aircraft carrier is not that big and there's aircraft parked on either side of the

305
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,200
landing area so you really can't afford to be you know off by very much and then angle of attack an

306
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:20,520
angle attack you know it's it's speed well the f-35 takes care of angle attack for you right so I

307
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:28,160
don't have to worry too much about that and now with Delta flight path it automatically once I'm

308
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,400
on glideslope I can engage it and it will capture and hold that three degree glideslope for me not

309
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,560
only does it do that but normally where the younger pilots will get themselves in trouble is and I

310
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:51,160
did you know many times trying to come aboard the boat is you get so focused on glideslope that

311
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,040
lineup will fall out of your scan and you'll you'll pick up a drift one way or the other and the LSOs

312
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,240
they'll give you you know a couple seconds to see if you're gonna correct it but if you don't start

313
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,320
to correct it they'll tell you hey you need to come one way or the other and this is normally

314
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,000
where younger pilots would get themselves in trouble because as soon as I now need to make

315
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,600
a lineup correction I may have had the power set perfectly but because I'm changing lift because

316
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm changing the drag profile because I'm banking the aircraft now I got to come up on the power and

317
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,600
now I have to reduce the power and then come back up so it's a three-part power correction and then

318
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,200
I got to do it again the other way and normally the pilot becomes so focused on lineup that the

319
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,920
or the glideslope falls out and now they end up having you know multiple corrections to have to

320
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:50,960
make well Delta flight path and what's called in the F-18 Magic Carpet it helps the pilot out

321
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,160
tremendously because if I start to drift one way or the other all I have to do now is put in

322
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,440
lateral stick input to make that lineup correction and the plane takes care of everything for me it

323
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,640
takes care of the power you know the F-35 has what we call triple ID DLC integrated direct lift so

324
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,360
really what's happening is I'm moving the stick around if I need to change you know I've started

325
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,040
to shallow out or I'm going low and I pull back on the stick actually the control surfaces all

326
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:31,040
deflect first to change the shape of the wing to change the camber and give me almost immediate

327
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:38,240
lift so the aircraft heaves back up right so you know whether you're talking about the F-35 and

328
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,400
like I said the Super Hornet has this capability coming back aboard the boat especially during the

329
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:51,200
day there's so many increased safety margins because of the capability that the digital flight

330
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,080
controls bring to the pilot the other thing that the F-35 pilot has to them is what we call a

331
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,200
ship's reference velocity vector and what that is it's a data link with the ship that actually

332
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:13,600
takes into account ships motion and now I have a piece of symbology that I'd basically put it on

333
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,360
the deck and that's where I'm gonna land so before when I was flying my legacy Hornet we

334
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,680
had a traditional velocity vector flight path marker so as you came around the corner you know

335
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,400
we made that approach turn during the day you'd use a little bit of Kentucky windage and you'd

336
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,400
put the velocity vector out in front of the ship a little bit and you know you'd you'd game it that

337
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:41,040
way a little bit but between the the symbology and the flight controls you know it's I won't say it's

338
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,480
easy and I used to say this when I flew you know the legacy Hornet that I would do anything that

339
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,000
the Navy asked me to do for free except land at the boat at night yeah I don't pay anybody enough

340
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,480
money to do that but the tools that we give the pilots now again it makes it easier it makes it

341
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:09,040
safer which allows them to again focus on the mission and not worry so much about boat operations

342
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,960
I know that's a side question but I tell you we could have a whole separate podcast on carrier

343
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,520
ops because it just those guys the shooters for example they just crack me up with the whole thing

344
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,040
we could have a whole separate podcast on that grant but we should move on absolutely a matter

345
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:31,680
of fact Ali's price saying don't get them started well let's shift on to a slightly different

346
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,720
question then and you touched on that briefly about the sensor fusion changing how you do

347
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,960
things so how has sensor fusion changed the way you plan and execute missions for example I'll

348
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:56,320
make a bold statement and say that it hasn't there you go okay because both the US way of

349
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:05,560
mission planning and prepping for a mission as well as you know our allies we you know we all

350
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:14,880
share that in common and whether mission planning is always intensive you're analyzing where the

351
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,840
target is what where the threats are what the threats are what are the threats vulnerabilities

352
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:29,960
to my strengths and how can I exploit that what are my vulnerabilities to the threat if any and

353
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,840
how do I defend against that right so all of that goes into mission planning sensor fusion

354
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:45,960
increases your mission planning a little bit because you want to put information into the

355
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:56,040
plane in your mission planning process that's going to bring sensor fusion or optimize sensor

356
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,080
fusion for whatever you're getting ready to whatever tactical challenge you're getting ready

357
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:14,280
to to go out and and fly against but more importantly it makes things easier in the plane

358
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:22,320
right so it really doesn't change how I how I mission plan that like I said there's a little

359
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:33,640
bit extra but the the benefit it brings is flexibility and what I mean by that is if the

360
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:41,560
scenario doesn't go how I expect it to and 99% of the time the scenarios don't go how you expect

361
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:48,600
them to there's additional threats or additional capability out there it allows the pilot to change

362
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:55,280
their game plan on the fly and change that game plan with ease and again it goes back to what I

363
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,280
was saying about you know the difference between taking eight to twelve years to attain a certain

364
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,440
tactical level and attain it now in two to four okay because yeah we all know Von Klauswitz no

365
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,960
plan survives first contact with the enemy and the other one that a wing commander I used to work

366
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:19,240
with was frequently saying to me was grant have I told you that flexibility wins wars which was

367
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,960
often a signal that he had done something that I needed to correct and fix but yeah those those

368
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,840
two things so yeah I could see what you're meaning there that flexibility that power of information

369
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:39,800
and ability to adapt is is critical in a especially in a dynamic war environment let alone war but any

370
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:47,000
environment that we're doing even even a training mission is quite dynamic so fantastic stuff so

371
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,040
I'm gonna go for bring us back into the cockpit and we've got the helmet you've told us a lot

372
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,400
about how that all that all works and how you got the screen the glass as you said how does all this

373
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:07,220
information get presented to you and and how do you identify key items at various points I imagine

374
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:13,220
that are you being illuminated by a radar is probably a higher priority than right now than

375
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,780
how much fuel you've got things like that but but how is that presented you see the videos of the

376
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,620
Super Hornets and they've got screens everywhere but you've just got that the glass and the helmet

377
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:29,100
so let's talk about the glass for just a second it's actually two different displays okay and we

378
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:35,580
do that for redundancy and safety so that if you lose one display you still have another one but the

379
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:44,980
glass itself can be broken up into four portals and each of those portals can either have one

380
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:54,300
display on it or one larger display in two smaller ones I can expand it out so that I've got you know

381
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:02,500
the display going across two portals right so I have multiple ways that I can configure the glass

382
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,940
for whatever the mission is you think of it like you know an iPad or an iPhone as far as you know

383
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:17,460
be being having that flexibility additionally the f-35 has five different modes in it we have

384
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:27,020
navigation air to air one air to air to dogfight and air to surface and each of those five modes

385
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:38,500
I can set up my displays again however I want it so I set it up on on on deck and matter of fact

386
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,380
we're getting the capability to actually set it up in mission planning so the pilot doesn't even

387
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:49,380
need to worry about setting it up on deck so the displays are already optimized for your mode and

388
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,820
your mode is tied to whatever your task is and it's obviously in the name of the mode right so air

389
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,980
to air one air to air two I'm doing some sort of air to air mission dogfight you know I'm mixing

390
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:08,500
it up and air to surface I'm executing I'm prosecuting a target on the ground now whether

391
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:16,060
you're talking about you know the glass and you know the f-35 and a fifth-gen fighter or you know

392
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:22,820
any of the other fourth-gen fighters out there one of the first tasks that a pilot needs to learn is

393
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:31,820
their scan where am I looking for what information and when yep yeah right so it because it's it

394
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:40,660
does me no good to be looking at my t-flare imagery if I'm trying to figure out you know

395
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:50,620
from you know EW or energy waves coming off an aircraft you know to help me identify it so it's

396
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:58,380
a matter of learning where to look and and when to look and again technology is is advancing right

397
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:07,140
and there's systems out there they're not in the f-35 yet it's you know still being tested on you

398
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:14,180
know multiple different helmets out there but not only you know I have a camera a mission replay

399
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:20,260
camera in the helmet so I know where the pilot's head is looking but here in the near future not

400
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,220
only are we going to know where the pilot's head is looking but we're going to know where the

401
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:29,900
pilot's eyes are looking and that's just going to aid in that training aspect right so the

402
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,740
instructor pilots are going to have the capability to come back and be like oh yeah your your head

403
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,300
was in the right place but you were looking in the wrong place right so it's a matter of learning

404
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:47,700
what to scan and and when to scan it and that just comes with training and experience yeah we

405
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,980
starting to see that in simulators now where they're doing the eye tracking while you're in

406
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,540
the sim so yeah no no huge surprise to hear that's going to wind up in the helmet as well

407
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,060
yeah so in terms of maturity of the platform I mean it's been under development now for many

408
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,420
many years how does how does Lockheed Martin see it going now are we are we in a in a spot where

409
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,380
we're happy obviously there's a process of continued improvement but where does the company see the

410
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:19,380
evolution of the aircraft as we sit here in 2023 so the the f-35 that's flying today is not the

411
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:28,900
same f-35 that was flying in 2010 okay one of the great strengths of the f-35 is it is a software

412
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:35,060
driven aircraft okay what do I mean by that when I was flying my fourth gen fighter you would get a

413
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:42,260
software update about every two years okay and with that software update came incremental

414
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:50,980
increases in capability but for real capability increases you had to change out boxes that came

415
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:58,580
in hardware changes we're in the process of doing tr3 tech refresh 3 this is only the third time

416
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,780
in the history of the aircraft that we are actually changing out hardware and we're doing

417
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:10,900
it because computer processing power has gotten better sensors have gotten better right and when

418
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:18,580
you compare that two-year software update cycle to what we push out now which is about every six

419
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:27,140
months yep right and again with each new software comes new capability so when I say that the

420
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:32,660
aircraft that's flying today resembles nothing of the aircraft that flew back in 2010 I'm talking

421
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:39,140
about the tactical capability that the aircraft had because of all the software updates that have

422
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:45,300
come along the way and now the third time that we're actually refreshing the hardware so when

423
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,900
you talk about you know what does the plane look like in 2040 what does the plane look like in 2070

424
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:58,500
the only answer I can give you is I don't know but I can't wait to see it right because I know

425
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:05,140
the new capabilities that are coming right around the corner you know as well as you know the future

426
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:11,780
capabilities that you know Lockheed's working on Lockheed Martin's working on and as a tactical

427
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,540
aviator I am excited to see what comes next yeah obviously there's so many of these aircraft flying

428
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,820
around the world these days I suppose it goes without saying that you're getting constant

429
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,540
feedback from of all different types from all around the world on different tweaks you might

430
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:32,660
like to make absolutely so one of the decisions that was made in the program early on was to use

431
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:41,860
this idea of concurrency so what do I mean by that when aircraft specifically tactical aircraft

432
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:48,660
went through you know their design and field process you know prior to the f-35 and you know

433
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:57,140
earlier they went through distinct phases they went through you know first the aircraft was built

434
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:03,060
some prototypes were built and they went through developmental tests DT and in that time period

435
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,580
you know test pilots such as myself we flew it we identified you know challenges and tweaks

436
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,340
you know we put them in we tested them out we're like okay yes it is past developmental flight

437
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,380
test now it's ready for operational tests and then we would send it on to operational tests and

438
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:26,180
the operational testers would do their thing right and then they again they'd identify challenges

439
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,380
and you know things that needed to be addressed it would get fixed and then it was sent finally

440
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:38,100
sent on to the fleet the end user where they would eventually ioc declare ioc or initial

441
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:45,460
operating capability the f-35 program went with this idea of concurrency and i can tell you as

442
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:52,660
a developmental flight or a developmental test pilot at first it was a little bit frustrating

443
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:58,580
because i was doing developmental tests in the aircraft's portion you know we weren't done

444
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:06,500
you know carving out the full envelope and we already had operational tests going on as well as

445
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:14,500
the services flying it operationally and the reason i say it was a little bit of a challenge

446
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,180
is because you know the the fleet pilot would come back or like well this doesn't work we're

447
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:27,060
like yes we know and and we're working we're working on it right but i i think my my personal

448
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:36,660
feeling now is that we have a much more robust system uh in the aircraft because of uh this

449
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:43,780
idea of concurrency because we got the end users involved in the design process if you will so

450
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:50,900
early so you know instead of you know an idea taking legs and running and then making it out

451
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,860
to the fleet and the fleet pilots being like i'm never going to use this why would you design it

452
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:04,260
that way they were able to identify that earlier right so and it's not just the u.s uh services

453
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,380
it's every nation that's been part of the program whenever they come onto the program

454
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,580
you know they start integrating into these processes that we have to help develop the

455
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:20,820
aircraft and make sure that when i make the statement that the f-35 is the most capable

456
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,260
the most survivable uh the most connected fighter flying on the face of the planet today i can say

457
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:33,140
that with confidence because i have however many pilots and country services to back that

458
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:40,420
statement up yep and uh for instance you've got a curl the australian canadian uk uh reprogramming

459
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:46,100
lab which uh yeah that's a major thing that's going on in the u.s at the moment where these

460
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:53,300
non-us five eyes groups are doing their their specific programming to help develop so that does

461
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,180
lead into the question the one that we're being from down under that we've got to ask is uh have

462
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:03,860
you had much to do with the the raf both personnel and aircraft and so on have you tested any of our

463
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:11,540
aircraft have you engaged a lot with australian personnel so uh i'll answer that in two two parts

464
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:19,300
um every australian air aircraft that has come off of the the line either i or a member of my

465
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:28,100
team have flown it so um as far as integration and interaction um with the australians

466
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:35,700
unfortunately uh no i haven't as a matter of fact um it's still on my to-do list to actually make it

467
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:43,380
down to australia i was in i was in the u.s navy we were doing an exercise in australia down in uh

468
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:50,340
tindle and uh it's actually that's that's where i earned my mission commander qual that you know

469
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:58,260
leading uh large forces uh you know into tactical scenarios and we were uh supposed to stop in

470
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,700
australia and i was super excited this was going to be my first time and the port call got cancelled

471
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:13,220
oh no so heartbreaking i've flown over uh i've flown over your country i've uh i've dropped um

472
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,980
you know practice ordinance on uh on your ranges but i've never had the opportunity to actually

473
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:24,740
come down and enjoy the culture well we need to rectify that i think absolutely i will have to

474
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,980
talk we will have to have a chat with ali at the end of this uh this recording

475
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,860
uh

476
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,420
so tony just as we uh come to the end of our time here um we never got around to asking you about

477
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,020
your call sign brick and of course we have to ask every fighter pilot uh that we come across

478
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,500
say how they came across their call sign and can you give us the pg version yeah the pg version

479
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:53,060
yeah yeah yeah this this does go out to radio and kids so absolutely so unfortunately um you

480
00:50:53,140 --> 00:51:01,940
probably can't tell from uh from the video but i'm a relatively short uh pilot uh short and stout

481
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:10,980
in nature so uh the call sign brick especially in my younger years was very fitting to uh my

482
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:19,460
build as well as my personality uh you know small dense uh rough around the edges uh i could be

483
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:26,900
abrasive uh trying to get me to change uh my mind on anything uh was like pushing on a brick wall

484
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:35,620
because uh some people say i have a tendency to be stubborn i disagree but uh the uh the other uh

485
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:42,820
the other story again with uh being short uh we carry uh basically an external hard drive

486
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:49,620
from mission planning out to the jet uh and we call that uh the brick so one of the running

487
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:55,940
jokes was how many bricks did i have to sit on so i could see outside the cockpit oh such a cruel

488
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:02,420
industry oh it is it is you gotta have thick skin oh yeah and not just for the debriefs

489
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,620
well brick thank you so much for coming on the show this has been awesome uh really appreciate

490
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,620
you taking the time and very conscious of the fact that we're almost at 7 pm on a friday evening

491
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,940
your time so that bourbon is just around the corner because we're going to wrap it here

492
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:25,060
absolutely hey i had uh a lot of fun you know if i can't be uh flying then talking about it's the

493
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:36,660
next best thing so i really appreciate the opportunity thank you look let's be honest sir

494
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,780
we've all got to eat that we do kevin food is such a big part of life isn't it and talking about

495
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,660
food can lead us to all sorts of places and all sorts of people yep and every week on the food

496
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,420
bites podcast we catch up with someone who might be a tv celebrity a high-profile sports star

497
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,220
a politician could be anyone and we talk to them about food their kitchen skills or you know

498
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:03,700
sometimes lack of uh life and and love and kevin every week there's the friday food poll oh yes

499
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,180
now that is food bites with sarah paterson and me kevin hillier you can find us wherever you

500
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,660
find your favorite podcast and of course every sunday morning at nine o'clock on the ace radio

501
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:18,340
network you're listening to plane crazy down under the show where we like to talk aviation and we

502
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,820
certainly love to talk about fighter jets in fact grant this week we're talking about the f-35

503
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,140
and back at uh avalon earlier in the year of course uh lockmart had a pretty uh big presence

504
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,860
there in the f-35 of course uh you know it was the jet that's taking everybody's attention

505
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,660
their director of international business development for the jet is stephen over

506
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,340
and he joined us for an interview on our our sister program can we call it that grant the

507
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,820
australian defense magazine podcast and we had a great chat with him the fine folks of the

508
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,140
australian defense magazine podcast allow us to use some of their content once it's been out on

509
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,940
their show for a bit here's a few excerpts of the key pieces that fit in with what tony was talking

510
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,700
about before we're incorporating an upgrade that we call block four so block four will span about

511
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,780
a seven or eight year time frame and it starts with some fairly significant hardware upgrades

512
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:12,340
to our mission systems or avionics as we call it this year we're breaking into production a new

513
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,900
computing baseline that will update the main mission computer on the aircraft

514
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,460
the computer that supports the cockpit displays and the aircraft memory system

515
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:26,740
and that creates a computing infrastructure that then we can leverage with future software upgrades

516
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,980
we're also incorporating a next-gen distributed aperture system this infrared camera that's

517
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:38,100
positioned around the airplane that allows the pilot to see hemispherically and infrared

518
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,820
and that new sensor it was it was principally put on the airplane to reduce cost and be

519
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,580
more supportable but it's going to have about a 2x improvement in detection range and detection

520
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,820
performance it's just a benefit of modern technology what pilot wouldn't love that

521
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:59,060
yeah and so that that starts the foundation australia's last nine airplanes that are

522
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,620
delivered this year will have that hardware baseline and then incrementally year over year

523
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,340
there's new software upgrades that will bring new weapons additional sensor modes and other

524
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:15,060
performance features that will keep this airplane at the cutting edge state-of-the-art military

525
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:22,740
capability so that australia the u.s and our allies will have the ability to deter aggression

526
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,820
from the adversaries that are out there for decades to come that's fantastic and will the

527
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,340
you mentioned that the last few will have that hardware capability is that plan to be

528
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,060
progressively applied to the existing fleets when they come in for major upgrades and it

529
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:42,420
absolutely is there's already a plan that we and the f-35 joint program office have worked with

530
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:48,980
the australian air force to factor their airplanes into a depot mod program at rdaf williamtown

531
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:54,740
and over the coming years their airplanes will all be upgraded to this common block four baseline

532
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,700
let's touch on sensor fusion well as an engineer i can tell you sensor fusion is

533
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:07,140
probably the most advanced state-of-the-art feature of the f-35 and i've you know focused on how do

534
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:13,140
you describe to people that aren't fighter pilots what sensor fusion is and the way i would relate

535
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,180
it is you have to contrast it with what a pilot that flies a fourth generation airplane is doing

536
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:24,180
versus a pilot that's flying the f-35 so the pilot that's flying a fourth generation airplane

537
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,420
the australian air force has some of the finest fourth generation airplanes in the world

538
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,460
with both classic and super horse guess the classics have been retired

539
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,980
um we produce one of the finest fourth generation airplanes also in the world the f-16 fighting

540
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:42,420
falcon great fourth-gen airplane right and so the pilot instinctually he knows how to fly the

541
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,740
airplane he doesn't have to think about how to control and maneuver the aircraft that's just

542
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:52,740
instinctual for it and so he has a dedicated display for each and every sensor he has in the

543
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:58,500
cockpit he has a radar and a dedicated display that shows him radar targeting he'll have electronic

544
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,300
warfare and a dedicated display that shows him what his electronic warfare system is seeing

545
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,940
and if he has the luxury of an infrared tracking system or some kind of infrared

546
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:13,940
detection system he may have a third display that shows him what that's that sensor is seeing and

547
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:21,860
most of his mental capacity is spent trying to glue it in his mind what each of these three

548
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:26,820
or four displays are showing him into a three-dimensional picture of the battle space

549
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:32,580
with f-35 we've taken the power of modern computing and almost nine million lines of

550
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:38,660
software source code and we've automated that functionality for the pilot so what he sees when

551
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:44,420
he sits in the cockpit is this large panoramic cockpit display it's about the size of two large

552
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:51,140
ipads and he'll typically have half of it dedicated to something we call a tactical situation display

553
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:56,660
it's this god's eye view of the battle space and he doesn't worry about individual sensors

554
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,380
any longer he doesn't worry about a radar he doesn't worry about electronic warfare he doesn't

555
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:10,020
worry about infrared it just all logically appears on his cockpit display and he never

556
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:15,220
has to worry about it as he's approaching the battle space he'll set range scales and targets

557
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:21,700
just magically appear pilots that have transitioned from fourth generation airplanes into f-35 they

558
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,500
will also tell you one of the things that's the biggest surprise to them not only is how well

559
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,820
sensor fusion tells you where everything is in the battle space but how well the intrinsic features

560
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,340
in the airplane also derive combat id yeah powerful powerful performance from it from the

561
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:43,300
airplane right so you not only know typically where everything is in the battle space but for

562
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:48,900
the most part you know what everything is as well yeah and so if you're flying the airplane

563
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:54,500
it's a significant workload reducer you're not trying to create a mental image of the battle

564
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:00,500
space you have this very logical view and so the pilot becomes a tactician and what we're seeing

565
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,420
as this airplane is being put in the hands of seasoned military pilots is even young first

566
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,900
lieutenant second lieutenants that have just transitioned to the f-35 are able to be battle

567
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:16,020
space commanders because they have the bandwidth they have they have the omniscience of what's

568
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,780
happening in the battle space they're making fourth generation airplanes better that are

569
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:24,180
collaborating with them well there you go and of course grants you can find the full interview

570
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:29,860
there in episode 42 of the australian defense magazine you can find that at australiandefense.com.au

571
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,420
and we do thank them for allowing us to use that audio in this program of course we do very proudly

572
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,300
produce that program on their behalf so it's always great to be able to you know get some

573
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:44,180
content out and run it in this show as well fantastic certainly is mate and a lot of fun

574
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:50,900
producing the australian defense magazine podcast as well but it does cover more than just aviation

575
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,460
but i think this episode has been chuck full of of content as our friends in the us would like to

576
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,660
say and it's probably time we start looking at wrapping this one up we do indeed thanks very

577
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,900
much for joining us of course we'd love to hear what you think about the f-35 lots of people have

578
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,900
lots of things to say about it we certainly hope that programs like this allow people to get a

579
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,300
much more detailed view on just what's going into that jet and some of the amazing technology

580
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:18,340
internet it really is amazing contact at plane crazy down under.com is where you can drop us

581
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:22,420
a line and we'd certainly love to hear from you on all sorts of topics about aviation we'll keep
